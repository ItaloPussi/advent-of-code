# Advent of Code 2023

## About
This is the [Advent of Code - Edition 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

This is my first official edition, so I choose the language I've more confidence to work it. All the challenges will solved with Python.

In general, I don't pretend to use external libs, but if necessary, I'll put the requirements in the folder of the given day.

Each challenge when runned will first try to fetch data using the "advent-of-code-data" plugin (you can read how to configure it (here)[https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/#description]). Secondly it will try to read a input.txt file in the given folder.

Some challenges coulld have different files and technologies.
