# Advent of Code 2023

## About
This is the [Advent of Code - Edition 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

This is my first official edition, so I choose the language I've more confidence to work it. All the challenges will solved with Python.

In general, I don't pretend to use external libs, but if necessary, I'll put the requirements in the folder of the given day.

Some challenges coulld have different files and technologies.
