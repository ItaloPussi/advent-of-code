# Mirage Maintenance (Day 09) - Advent of Code 2023 

## The First Star
Given a list of sequences, extrapolate the next number to the right for each of them. Calculate the sum of all this numbers.

Example:
```
0 3 6 9 12 15
1 3 6 10 15 21
10 13 16 21 30 45

The next number of each sequence is respectively: 18, 28 and 68. The sum is 114
```

## The Second Star
Now, the inverse: Given a list of sequences, extrapolate the next number to the left for each of them. Calculate the sum of all this numbers.

Example:
```
0 3 6 9 12 15
1 3 6 10 15 21
10 13 16 21 30 45

The next number of each sequence is respectively: -3, 0 and 5. The sum is 2
```

## Running the code
To run the code, just use the following command in this directory in a environment with Python3 installed and it will give you the result:
```
