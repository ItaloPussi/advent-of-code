# If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer (Day 05) - Advent of Code 2023 

## The First Star
A Given almanac (your puzzle input) lists all of the seeds that need to be planted. It also lists what type of soil to use with each kind of seed, what type of fertilizer to use with each kind of soil, what type of water to use with each kind of fertilizer, and so on. Every type of seed, soil, fertilizer and so on is identified with a number, but numbers are reused by each category - that is, soil 123 and fertilizer 123 aren't necessarily related to each other.
Mapping a seed by each almanac part will result in a location. The challenge is to get the minimum location based in all the seeds.

## The Second Star
Now, treat the the values on the initial seeds as pairs. Within each pair, the first value is the start of the range and the second value is the length of the range.

## Running the code
To run the code, just use the following command in this directory in a environment with Python3 installed and it will give you the result:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 main.py
```
